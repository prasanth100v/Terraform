# 🔁 What is a Dynamic Block?
  * 🚀 A dynamic block is used when you want to create multiple repeating parts of a resource using a `loop`, instead of writing them manually.
  * Why use it ❓
      * Sometimes you need to create repeated blocks (like `multiple security group rules`), and instead of writing each one manually, you can use a dynamic block.
      * Simple Idea `Manual repetition ❌ → Dynamic loop ✅`
      * 🔁 Avoid repeating code
      * 📦 Handle multiple similar configurations
      * ✨ Make code clean & reusable

## 🧾 Simple Example: Creating Security Group Rules
Let’s say you want to allow two ports — `80 and 443` — in a security group.

### ✍️ Without Dynamic Block (❌ `manual`)
```
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name = "example-sg"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```
👉 Manual repetition : You wrote two repeated blocks yourself. What if you need 10 or more? That’s too much work.


### ⚡ With a Dynamic Block (✅ easy and clean)
```
variable "allowed_ports" {
  default = [80, 443]
}

resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name = "example-sg"

  dynamic "ingress" {
    for_each = var.allowed_ports                    # 🔁 loop through each port (80, 443)
    content {
      from_port   = ingress.value
      to_port     = ingress.value
      protocol    = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
  }
}
```

## ✅ Conclusion:

 - ✨ You don’t have to write each manually.  
 - 🧠 But it’s good to write `one or two manually` first just to understand the structure.  
 - 🔄 Then you can use `for_each` inside a dynamic block to make your code flexible and reusable.

# 🔁 What is `for_each`?

 * for_each is used in Terraform to create multiple resources from a `list or map`.
 * It’s like a `loop` : instead of repeating code, Terraform creates resources based on input data.
 * I use `for_each` when I need to `create multiple resources with unique values`, as it provides better control and stability compared to `count`."

### 📄 Example 
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "buckets" {
  for_each = {
    dev  = "dev-bucket"
    prod = "prod-bucket"
  }

  bucket = each.value
}
```

### 🔁 for_each vs 🔢 count in Terraform
| 🧩 Feature / Aspect    | 🔢 `count`                                  | 🔁 `for_each`                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 🎯 Purpose             | 📦 Create multiple resources using a number | 🗂️ Create multiple resources using map/set |
| 📥 Input Type          | 🔢 Integer (`count = 3`)                    | 🧩 Map/Set (`{a=1, b=2}` / `toset([...])`)  |
| 🔍 Accessing Resources | 📍 Index (`resource[0]`, `resource[1]`)     | 🔑 Key (`resource["a"]`, `resource["b"]`)   |
| 🎯 Best Use Case       | 📦 Identical resources                      | 🎨 Unique resources (different configs)     |
| 🔄 Flexibility         | ⚠️ Less flexible                            | ✅ More flexible                             |
| 🔁 Handling Changes    | ❌ Index shift → resource recreation         | ✅ Stable keys → no unnecessary recreation   |
| 📖 Readability         | ⚠️ Harder in complex cases                  | ✅ Better with meaningful keys               |
| 🔀 Conditional Usage   | ✅ Easy (`count = condition ? 1 : 0`)        | ⚠️ Slightly complex (use `{}` for false)    |
| 🧪 Example             | `count = 2`                                  | `for_each = {web=80, app=8080}`             |
| 🆔 Resource Identity   | 🔢 Based on index                           | 🔑 Based on key                             |

### ✅ When to Use What?
  * Use `count` 👉 when resources are `same and simple`
      * Index-based (`0,1,2`)
  * Use `for_each` 👉 when resources are different or need `unique names/values`
      * Key-based (`web, app`)

## 📦 4. What are `Terraform modules`, and how do you use them?

 * 🚀 Modules : 👉 Reusable Terraform components, Like Function (`write once, reuse everywhere`)
 * Modules help me write `DRY code` by reusing the same infrastructure logic across environments.
 * 📦 I create root modules for each environment and use `child modules` for resources like `VPC`, `EC2`, or `RDS`.
 * 📦 I also keep common modules in a `separate Git repo` or `folder structure` and version them using `Git tags`.
 * 🎯 I use modules to reuse infrastructure code across environments, keeping my Terraform code `clean`, `scalable`, and `maintainable`.

## 🛠️ Common Terraform CLI Commands (Interview-Style Summary):

 * I regularly use Terraform CLI commands like `init` to set up my project, plan to `preview changes`, apply to make them, and destroy to remove them.
 * I also use `fmt` and `validate` for formatting and syntax checking, and `import` or `taint` when I need to manage or recreate existing resources.
 * ⚡ One-line : `👉 Terraform = Init 🚀 → Plan 📊 → Apply ⚙️ → Destroy 💥 + Helpers 🎨`

# 🚫 What is ignore_changes?

In Terraform, when something changes outside Terraform, it will try to fix it during terraform plan and terraform apply. But sometimes, you don’t want Terraform to fix it.

You want Terraform to ignore the change. That’s where ignore_changes helps.

## 💡 Simple Meaning:  
“Ignore this field if it changes outside Terraform.”

---

## 🌍 Real-Life Example:

Let’s say you have this EC2 instance. Now, someone (or another script) manually changes the Name tag ("MyServer") in the AWS Console to "ChangedManually".

When you run: terraform plan  
Terraform will say:  
“Hey! This tag has changed. I want to fix it back to MyServer!”

But you don’t want Terraform to care about this change.

---

## 🛠️ Solution: Use ignore_changes

lifecycle {
  ignore_changes = [tags]
}

Now, even if the tag is changed manually in AWS, Terraform will ignore it during plan/apply.

---

## 🎤 Very Simple Interview Answer:

“I use ignore_changes when I don’t want Terraform to react to small changes made outside Terraform — like someone changing a tag manually or a system auto-updating a value. This avoids unnecessary changes during terraform apply.”

## ⭐ Standard Interview Answer
“Terraform variables are used to pass dynamic values into configurations instead of hardcoding them. They help us reuse the same code across multiple environments like dev, test, and prod by changing only the variable values.”

#### Simple Example
“For example, instead of hardcoding an EC2 instance type, I define it as a variable. In dev I can use t2.micro, and in prod I can use t3.large, without changing the Terraform code.”

### ⭐ Why are variables important?
“Variables prevent hardcoding, reduce duplication, improve readability, and make Terraform code scalable across multiple environments and teams.”

### ❌ What NOT to Say (Common Mistake)
> 🚫 “Variables are just values stored in Terraform” ✔️ Always mention reusability + environments + no hardcoding

## Types of Variables in Terraform
#### 🔹 Input Variables (most common)
```
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
}
```
##### Use it like this:
> instance_type = var.instance_type

### 🔹 Output Variables
Used to display or pass values after terraform apply.
```
output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.web.id
}
```

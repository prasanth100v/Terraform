## ⭐ Standard Interview Answer
“Terraform variables are used to pass dynamic values into configurations instead of hardcoding them. They help us reuse the same code across multiple environments like dev, test, and prod by changing only the variable values.”

### ⭐ Simple Example
“For example, instead of hardcoding an EC2 instance type, I define it as a variable. In dev I can use t2.micro, and in prod I can use t3.large, without changing the Terraform code.”
